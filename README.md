# KindBlood

KindBlood, an open source blood donation helper app, made for class mini project 2023.
## Usage
The aim of this app is to allow users to quickly find potential blood donation volunteers from the user's contacts or through an online database.  
This is done by storing the blood group and location coordinates of each contact, and calculating the blood group compatibility and minimum distance from user on demand.  
Online mode works by communicating with a [KindBlood server](https://github.com/AmanAnifer/kindblood_server), which can be used to find even more volunteers.

## Technologies used
Flutter/Dart for the app, Shelf/Dart for backend server, SQLite for database, REST-based API using JSON for communication.
